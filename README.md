## What is the game of life?


The  Game of Life is a  cellular automaton devised by the British  mathematician [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway "John Horton Conway")  in 1970.

The game is a  zero-player game meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

## Rules
The universe of the _Game of Life_ is an infinite, two-dimensional  grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or _populated_ and _unpopulated_). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
